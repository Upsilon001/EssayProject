<h1>Auther: BENJAMIN</h1>
<h1>Title: 20 Questions</h1>

<h2>“Is it bigger than a breadbox?”</h2>

<h4>“Yes.”</h4>

I have always been tall, decidedly tall. Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height.<br>
 Starting at a young age, I would ask countless questions, from “How heavy is the Earth?”<br>
to “Where does rain come from?” My curiosity, displayed in questions like these,
has truly defined me as a person and as a student.<br>
Therefore, it is not surprising that I became transfixed the first time I played 20 Questions
(the electronic version of Twenty Questions).<br>
Somehow, a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking.<br>
The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in 20Q.<br>
This interest would later reveal valuable character traits of mine while also paralleling
various facets of my life.<br>

“Does it strive to learn?”<br>

“Yes.”<br>

I became determined to discover how 20Q guessed correctly.<br>
After some research, I discovered artificial intelligence, more specifically,
artificial neural networks—systems which learn and improve themselves.<br>
This idea fascinated me.<br>
I wanted to learn more. I read avidly, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could.<br>
When given the opportunity years later,
 I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me.<br>

 I found myself in an environment I loved.<br>
 I would stay after class, go in during free periods,
 make my own apps, and work over Cloud-based IDEs.<br>
I prized the freedom and the possibilities.<br>

“Is it driven?”<br>

“Yes.”<br>

After my introduction to 20Q.<br>
I began to play Twenty Questions (the traditional parlor game)
and became determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the artificial intelligence. At first I was mediocre.<br>
However, through long car rides with family, good-natured yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy,
and time, I became more effective. I discovered the “secrets” to success: practice and perseverance.<br>

“Does it apply what it learns?”<br>

“Yes.”<br>

 Throughout high school, I applied the “secret” of practice to my basketball career.<br>
 I spent countless hours sharpening my skills in 90° summer heat to 20° late-winter cold countless afternoons
 playing pickup games with my friends,
   and countless weekends traveling to AAU basketball tournaments.<br>
   As a result, I became a starter for my school’s varsity team.<br>
   I applied another “secret,” this time the “secret” of perseverance,
   by dedicating myself to physical therapy after knee surgery in order to quickly return to football.<br>
   Later that year, I became the first player in my grade to score a varsity touchdown<br>

“Does it attempt to better itself?”<br>

“Yes.”<br>
